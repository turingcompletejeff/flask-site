From a young age, I was fascinated with taking things apart and
putting them back together. When I was first introduced to computers, I saw
an entire universe of possibilites. 
<br /><br />
In high school, I pursued networking and was captivated by the complexity
of computing at every layer. 
<br /><br />
Afterward, I attended <a href="https://www.mst.edu/">Missouri
University of Science & Technology</a>, where I explored electronics, 
engineering, and computer science. There, I learned to build robust 
algorithms and the hardware to support them. I became treasurer of the local
<a href="https://www.acm.org/">ACM</a> chapter, and joined a 
cyber security club. In both groups, I collaborated with other
students to run hands-on workshops and facilitated presentations from guest
speakers on campus. 
<br /><br />
After graduating, I put my algorithms and software engineering skills to the
test at <a href="https://www.oreillyauto.com/">O'Reilly Auto</a>. For much
of my career there, I supported internal business analysts by designing 
new web apps and maintaining existing ones. Many of these applications
relied on SQL to handle large, continuous streams of parts data, 
delivering it to analysts through streamlined workflows and dashboards.
