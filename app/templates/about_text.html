From a young age, I have always been interested in taking things apart and
putting them back together. When I was first introduced to computers, I saw
a universe of possibilites. 

Throughout high school, I pursued networking, finding the endless complexity
at every layer of computing. 

After high school, I went to Missouri University of Science & Technology,
where I dove into electronics, engineering, and of course computer science.
Here, I learned to build robust algorithms and the hardware with which to
run it. I joined the local chapter of ACM, serving as its treasurer, and
joined a cyber security club. In both of these groups, I collaborated with
other students to run practical workshops and facilitated presentations
from guest speakers on campus. 

After graduating, I put my algorithms & software engineering skills to the
test at O'Reilly Auto. For the majority of my career here, I supported
internal business analysts by designing new web apps and maintaining
existing ones. Many of the apps I built here used SQL to conquer large,
constant streams of part data, bringing them to analysts' fingertips in
simple workflows and dashboards.
